# ReHLDS Docker

# Fork of HLDS Docker dproto

This started out from the docker setup for "Half-Life Dedicated Server as a Docker Image". Now, it serves as a Counter-Strike 1.6 Dedicated Server as a Docker image.
Aside from the difference from the original, this is using an updated version of Debian and changes to some of the modules and plugins.

## Half-Life Dedicated Server as a Docker image

Probably the fastest and easiest way to set up an old-school Counter-Strike 1.6 server.
Both Steam and noSteam, old and new
half-life clients can connect and play together! You don't need to know
anything about Linux or ReHLDS to start a server. You just need Docker and
this image.

## Quick Start

Start a new server by running:

```bash
docker run --name "cstrike" -p 27015:27015 -p 27015:27015/udp blsalin/rehlds-cstrike
```

This will create a container named "cstrike" with the 27015 port open (on UDP and TCP).

## What is included

* [ReHLDS Build](https://github.com/dreamstalker/rehlds) `3.13.0.788`.

  ```
    Protocol version 48
    Exe version 1.1.2.7/Stdio (cstrike)
    Exe build: 07:36:33 Jul 12 2023 (3378)

  ```

* [Metamod-r](https://github.com/theAsmodai/metamod-r) version `1.3.0.138`

* Patched list of master servers (official and unofficial master servers
  included), so your game server appear in game server browser of all the clients

* Minimal config present, such as `mp_timelimit` and mapcycle

## Default mapcycle

* de_dust2
* de_inferno

## Advanced

Check out the example under server-example. It allows adding maps and configurations by appending (and overwriting) the original cstrike folder.
The example contains an override for the mapcycle file.


This is how you can run the advanced docker-compose: 
```bash
docker build . --tag rehlds-cstrike
cd server-example
docker-compose up -d --build
```
